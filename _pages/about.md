Welcome to my homepage.

I am a Lecturer in Economics at the Department of Economics, [University of Aberdeen Business School](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/business/). I received a Ph.D in Economics at the School of Social Science, [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/sss/economics). 

My research interests lie at the intersection of **development** and **cultural** economics. You can read about my research [here](research).
